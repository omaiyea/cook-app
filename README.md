# What Should I Cook?
This app helps users to easily decide what to cook without overwhelming them with options. If they can't choose what to cook from a limited set of recipes, they are returned restaurants nearby or can choose to see more recipes.

## Motivation
There are lots of websites and apps that try to help you decide what to cook/eat. Some aren't personalized to your diets or what ingredients you actually have on hand, and most have so many options that you're just endlessly scrolling and getting hungrier. This app attempts to address both of these.
